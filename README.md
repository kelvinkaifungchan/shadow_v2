# shadow
shadow simplifies the process of teaching students how to speak, listen and write second languages online.

## Product Overview
shadow is targeted towards private tutors who teach students through online classes. What we realised in the process of conducting our research was that while there were many platforms helping tutors find students, there were few that provided the features to help them create engaging content for those students.

At its core, shadow's platform provides the ability to create three different types of cards flashcards, that help students practice speaking, quizcards that help students practice listening and dictationcards that help students practice writing. Cards are then organised into groups known as sets that help teachers group cards based on topic or lessons, and classrooms that help teachers group sets to create a continous curriculum. Sets and Classrooms can then be shared with students.

Additional features include a login system, profile pictures, tagging and search system to sort through cards.
